## 1. Getting Started

When you open the Quill Editor, you'll see a familiar word-processor-like interface:

- **Toolbar**: The row of buttons at the top. This is where you'll find all formatting options.
- **Editor Canvas**: The large white area below the toolbar. This is where you type and edit your document.

**Your First Step**: Click anywhere in the Editor Canvas and start typing. It's that simple!

---

## 2. Typography & Text Formatting

This section covers how to control the appearance of your text: fonts, sizes, styles, and colors.

---

### 2.1 Choosing a Font

The editor provides **7 carefully selected fonts** to suit different content types:

| Font Name | Best For | Example Use Case |
|-----------|----------|------------------|
| **Sans Serif** (Default) | General content | Everyday documents |
| **Roboto** | Modern, clean look | Tech reports, websites |
| **Open Sans** | Friendly, readable | Newsletters, emails |
| **Lato** | Professional, neutral | Business proposals |
| **Montserrat** | Bold, impactful | Headlines, marketing |
| **Source Code Pro** | Code/technical data | Software documentation |
| **Crimson Pro** | Formal, traditional | Legal documents, books |
| **DM Sans** | Contemporary | Presentations |

#### How to Change the Font:

1. **Select the text** you want to change. (Click and drag your mouse over the text.)
2. Click the **Font dropdown** in the toolbar (it shows the current font name).
3. Choose your desired font from the list.

> **Example**: To make a report title look formal, select the title text and choose *Crimson Pro*.

#### Bonus: Smart Font Mapping

If you paste text from Microsoft Word or Google Docs that uses fonts like **Arial** or **Times New Roman**, the editor automatically converts them to the closest available font:
- Arial → Roboto
- Times New Roman → Crimson Pro
- Courier New → Source Code Pro

This ensures your document looks consistent, even when combining content from different sources.

---

### 2.2 Adjusting Font Size

The editor offers **4 size options** to create visual hierarchy:

| Size | Appearance | Use Case |
|------|------------|----------|
| **Small** | Compact text | Footnotes, captions, fine print |
| **Normal** | Standard body | Regular paragraphs |
| **Large** | Slightly bigger | Sub-headings, emphasis |
| **Huge** | Very prominent | Titles, major headings |

#### How to Change Font Size:

1. **Select the text** you want to resize.
2. Click the **Size dropdown** in the toolbar.
3. Choose: *Small*, *Normal*, *Large*, or *Huge*.

> **Example**: For a document subtitle, select the text and choose *Large*.

---

### 2.3 Basic Text Styles

These are the fundamental ways to emphasize or decorate text:

| Style | What It Does | Keyboard Shortcut |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Bold** | Makes text **heavier/darker** | `Ctrl + B` (Windows) / `Cmd + B` (Mac) |
| *Italic* | Slants text for *emphasis* | `Ctrl + I` / `Cmd + I` |
| <u>Underline</u> | Draws a line <u>under</u> text | `Ctrl + U` / `Cmd + U` |
| ~~Strikethrough~~ | Draws a line ~~through~~ text | No shortcut (use toolbar) |

#### How to Apply Styles:

**Method 1: Toolbar Buttons**
1. Select the text.
2. Click the **B** (Bold), *I* (Italic), **U** (Underline), or **S̶** (Strikethrough) button.

**Method 2: Keyboard Shortcuts**
1. Select the text.
2. Press the keyboard shortcut (e.g., `Ctrl + B` for Bold).

> **Example**: To emphasize a key term, select the word and press `Ctrl + B` to make it **bold**.

#### Removing a Style:

To remove a style, simply select the styled text and click the same button again (or press the shortcut again). For example, clicking **B** on bold text will un-bold it.

---

### 2.4 Scientific Notation

For technical, scientific, or mathematical content, you can use:

| Notation | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Subscript** | Text shrinks and moves below the baseline | H₂O (water) |
| **Superscript** | Text shrinks and moves above the baseline | E=mc² (energy equation) |

#### How to Apply Subscript/Superscript:

1. **Select the text** that should be subscript or superscript (e.g., the "2" in "H2O").
2. Click the **X₂** button for Subscript OR the **X²** button for Superscript.

> **Example**: To write the chemical formula for water:
> 1. Type `H2O`.
> 2. Select just the `2`.
> 3. Click the **Subscript** (X₂) button.
> 4. Result: H₂O

---

### 2.5 Text Colors

Add visual distinction with text colors and highlights.

#### Text Color (Foreground)

Changes the color of the letters themselves.

1. Select the text.
2. Click the **A** button with a colored underline (Text Color).
3. Pick a color from the palette.

> **Example**: To make a warning red, select "Warning: Do not proceed" and choose a red color.

#### Background Color (Highlight)

Adds a colored background behind the text, like a highlighter.

1. Select the text.
2. Click the **Highlighter** button (color bucket icon).
3. Pick a highlight color from the palette.

> **Example**: To highlight an important date, select "Deadline: January 15" and choose yellow.

---

### 2.6 Clearing All Formatting

Made a mess with too many styles? The **Clean** button removes all formatting at once.

#### How to Clear Formatting:

1. **Select the text** with unwanted formatting.
2. Click the **Eraser** (Clean) button in the toolbar.
3. The text reverts to plain, default formatting.

> **When to Use**: After pasting content from an email or website that has inconsistent styling.

---

## 3. Document Structure

This section covers how to organize your content with headings, lists, and special blocks.

---

### 3.1 Headings

Headings create a hierarchy in your document, making it easier to scan and navigate.

| Level | Size | Use Case |
|-------|------|----------|
| **Heading 1** | Largest | Document title |
| **Heading 2** | Very large | Major sections |
| **Heading 3** | Large | Sub-sections |
| **Heading 4** | Medium-large | Topics within sub-sections |
| **Heading 5** | Medium | Minor points |
| **Heading 6** | Smallest heading | Fine distinctions |

#### How to Apply a Heading:

1. Place your cursor on the line you want to make a heading (or select the text).
2. Click the **Header dropdown** in the toolbar (shows "Normal" by default).
3. Choose *Heading 1*, *Heading 2*, etc.

> **Example Document Structure**:
> ```
> Heading 1: Quarterly Report
>   Heading 2: Financial Summary
>     Heading 3: Revenue
>     Heading 3: Expenses
>   Heading 2: Operational Updates
> ```

#### Reverting to Normal Text:

If you accidentally apply a heading, select the text and choose **Normal** from the Header dropdown.

---

### 3.2 Text Alignment

Control how text is positioned horizontally.

| Alignment | Description | Use Case |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Left** | Text starts from the left (default) | Body paragraphs |
| **Center** | Text is centered | Titles, quotes |
| **Right** | Text aligns to the right edge | Dates, signatures |
| **Justify** | Text stretches to fill both edges | Formal reports, newspapers |

#### How to Align Text:

1. **Select the paragraph(s)** you want to align.
2. Click the **Alignment** button in the toolbar (looks like horizontal lines).
3. Choose your alignment from the dropdown.

> **Example**: To center a document title:
> 1. Select the title text.
> 2. Click the Alignment dropdown.
> 3. Choose **Center**.

---

### 3.3 Text Direction (LTR/RTL)

If you're writing in a language that reads Right-to-Left (like Arabic or Hebrew), you can toggle the text direction.

#### How to Switch to RTL:

1. Place your cursor in the paragraph.
2. Click the **RTL** button in the toolbar (arrows pointing right-to-left).

The paragraph will now flow from right to left, and the alignment will flip accordingly.

---

### 3.4 Lists

---

### 5.2 Resizing Images

Once an image is inserted, you can resize it.

#### Using Drag Handles:

1. **Click the image** to select it.
2. **8 small handles** appear around the edges (corners and sides).
3. **Drag any handle** to resize:
   - Corner handles maintain the aspect ratio (proportional).
   - Side handles can distort the image (use carefully).

#### Using Preset Sizes:

When you select an image, a **floating toolbar** appears with quick options:

| Button | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **25%** | Sets image width to 25% of the editor width |
| **50%** | Sets image width to 50% of the editor width |
| **75%** | Sets image width to 75% of the editor width |
| **100%** | Makes the image full-width |
| **Reset** | Reverts to the image's original dimensions |

#### Deleting an Image:

1. Select the image.
2. Click the **Delete** button in the floating toolbar, OR press the **Delete** or **Backspace** key.

---

### 5.3 Aligning Images

Control how text flows around your image.

| Alignment | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| **Float Left** | Image moves to the left; text wraps on the right |
| **Center** | Image is centered; no text wrapping |
| **Float Right** | Image moves to the right; text wraps on the left |

#### How to Align:

1. **Click the image** to select it.
2. In the floating toolbar, click one of the alignment icons.

3. Click **Insert**.

#### Video Controls:

- **Play/Pause**: Double-click the video to toggle playback.
- **Resize**: Same as images—use drag handles or preset buttons.
- **Align**: Same as images—float left, center, or float right.

---

### 5.5 Drag & Drop Media

You can reposition images and videos by dragging them.

#### How It Works:

1. **Hover** over an image or video.
2. A **drag icon** (↗) appears in the corner.
3. **Click and hold** the drag icon.
4. **Drag** the media to a new location (even into a table cell).
5. **Release** to drop.

> **Smart Preservation**: When you drag media, the editor remembers its size and alignment. Even after moving it into a table, it retains these properties.

---

## 6. Hyperlinks

Connect your document to websites, emails, or other resources.

---

### 6.1 Creating a Link

> **Result**: The selected text becomes clickable and typically turns blue and underlined.

---

### 6.2 Editing or Removing a Link

#### Editing a Link:

1. **Click on the linked text**.
2. A small **link tooltip** appears showing the current URL.
3. Click the **Edit** (pencil) icon.
4. Change the URL and save.

#### Removing a Link:

1. **Click on the linked text**.
2. In the link tooltip, click the **Remove** (trash or X) icon.
3. The text remains, but it's no longer a link.

---

## 7. Workflow Tools

These features help you work efficiently.

---

### 7.1 Undo & Redo

Made a mistake? No problem.

| Action | Keyboard Shortcut | Effect |
|--------|-------------------|--------|
| **Undo** | `Ctrl + Z` / `Cmd + Z` | Reverts the last change |
| **Redo** | `Ctrl + Y` / `Cmd + Shift + Z` | Restores what you just undid |

#### How It Works:

- The editor remembers up to **100 changes**.
- Rapid typing is grouped together (so one Undo reverts a whole sentence, not each letter).
- You can also use the **Undo/Redo buttons** in the toolbar if visible.

---

### 7.2 Zooming In and Out

Need to see more detail or fit more content on screen?

#### Zoom Controls:

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Zoom In** | Makes everything bigger (up to 300%) |
| **Zoom Out** | Makes everything smaller (down to 50%) |
| **Reset** | Returns to 100% (normal view) |

#### How to Zoom:

If zoom controls are visible in your toolbar or status bar:
1. Click the **+** button to zoom in.
2. Click the **−** button to zoom out.
3. Click the **percentage** or **Reset** button to return to 100%.

> **Note**: Zooming only affects your view—it doesn't change the actual document font sizes.

---

### 7.3 Smart Paste

When you paste content from other applications (Word, Excel, websites), the editor intelligently handles it.

#### What Happens Automatically:

| Source Content | Editor Behavior |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Text with Arial font | Converts to Roboto |
| Text with Times New Roman | Converts to Crimson Pro |
| Colors like `rgb(255,0,0)` | Converts to `#ff0000` (cleaner format) |
| Bold/Italic styles | Preserved correctly |
| Tables from Excel/Word | Structure preserved |

#### Best Practice:

If pasted content looks inconsistent:
1. Select the problematic text.
2. Click **Clear Formatting** (Eraser button).
3. Re-apply only the styles you need.

---

## 8. Keyboard Shortcuts Reference

Quick access to common actions:

| Category | Action | Windows/Linux | Mac |
|----------|--------|---------------|-----|
| **Styling** | Bold | `Ctrl + B` | `Cmd + B` |
| | Italic | `Ctrl + I` | `Cmd + I` |
| | Underline | `Ctrl + U` | `Cmd + U` |

---

## 9. Tips & Best Practices

### Document Organization

- **Use Headings Consistently**: Create a clear hierarchy (H1 for title, H2 for sections, H3 for sub-sections).
- **One Idea Per Paragraph**: Keep paragraphs focused for easier reading.
- **Use Lists for Steps or Items**: Bullets and numbers are easier to scan than long paragraphs.

### Visual Design

- **Limit Font Variety**: Stick to 2-3 fonts maximum in one document.
- **Use Color Sparingly**: Too many colors can be distracting.
- **Align Images Thoughtfully**: Float images left/right only when text should wrap around them.

### Tables

- **Always Use Header Rows**: They make data tables much easier to understand.
- **Keep Tables Simple**: Avoid deeply nested or merged cells unless absolutely necessary.
- **Size Tables Appropriately**: A 75% width table often looks better than a 100% width one.

### Before Sharing

- **Proofread**: Use the zoom feature to review your document at 100% and 150%.
- **Check Links**: Click each link to ensure it goes to the correct destination.
- **Clear Unwanted Formatting**: If you pasted content from various sources, do a final formatting check.
